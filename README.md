## Project Description
Imagine that I work for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. I would be asked to create a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. 

The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.
